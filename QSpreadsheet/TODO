QSpreadsheet TODO LIST

Fix any bugs

Optimise the sort() code to use loops and arrays to allow a better interface and more/less keys and allow sorting by rows and columns
   (basically make it more flexible and powerful)

Enable reading and writing in other formats, excel workbook, csv, odt etc.

Make copying/cutting and pasting for flexible
    3.1. Allow copying/cutting of multiple selections lists
    3.2. Allow pasting into a selection size that is not the same size as the clipboard

Expand spreadsheet size -> make number of rows more than 999 and columns more than 26

If possible, change Cell::setDirty() to a different, more logical name, such as setRecalcNeeded() ----- done

May need to check cell reference is not out of range when reading file.

Expand Cell::evalexpression to allow JS style code

Research, test and add other neccessary functions

Write configure files, makefiles. etc.

Research the mutable keyword
